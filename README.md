# EDA on the loan portfolio for a large financial institution.
---
## Introduction:
 This is a project assigned to me by AiCore as part of my Data Analytics Bootcamp, during this project I have been tasked with performing an in depth analysis on a koan portfolio of a mock company using different statistical and data visualisation techniques to find insights, patterns, anomalies and relationships found within the loan data.

## Roadmap:
Since this is particularly early in the project the first few steps on the agenda are the following:

1. [x] Finish implementing ```db_utils.py``` to correctly connect and extract data from the database in the cloud.
1. [ ] Familiarise myself with the data.
1. [ ] Clean and transform the data
1. [ ] Find insights from within the data and correctly visualise them.
